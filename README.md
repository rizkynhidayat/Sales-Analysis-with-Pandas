# Sales Analysis with Pandas

## Overview
This project demonstrates a sales analysis workflow using Pandas. The dataset spans 12 months of sales data, originally stored in separate CSV files. The primary goals of this project include merging the data, performing data cleaning, and conducting basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends.

## Project Structure

- **Data Merging**: 
    - Combines 12 individual CSV files (one for each month) into a single dataset.
    
- **Data Cleaning**: 
    - Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and corrects data types to ensure the data is consistent and ready for analysis.
    
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
    - Conducts basic analysis such as calculating total sales per product, identifying top-selling products, and visualizing trends over time.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following key features:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **Product**: Name of the product sold.
- **Quantity Ordered**: Number of units sold.
- **Price Each**: Price per unit of the product.
- **Order Date**: Date and time when the order was placed.
- **Purchase Address**: Address where the product was shipped.
